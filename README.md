### :pencil: About this project
- This project is owned by [@harshfeudal](https://github.com/harshfeudal). You can join my Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/BAk2CXpRAT)!
- This respiratory is under-construction! I'll update it as soon as possible.
- I'm not highly recommended you to use C++ to code a Discord bot, instead of JavaScript or others library. To know how's this project works, you should learn some basics about C++ so that you can know what I am doing.

### üìö Libraries and version
These are libraries that we're using in this project:
- [Dpp](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP) - version `10.0.20` (latest)
- [Spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) - version `1.10.0` (latest)

Bot current version: 
- BETA version - `0.1.3.0` (`Release`)
- Stable version - `Unknown`

### üö® Generate and use
 This project was made by Visual Studio, so basically you cannot see my `.sln` file to open because I have ignored it. To use this project, you should generate it by using [Premake](https://premake.github.io/).

 So basically, I have written `premake5.lua` for generating it (still working with that file, I'll finish it ASAP). Here are these steps:
 1. Download `premake5.exe` from [their website](https://premake.github.io/)
 2. Open the correct folder that you've downloaded this project, put that `premake5.exe` file into this project (put that file where you can see the `Raiden Shogun.rc` located)
 3. On the navigation bar, for example `D:/Harshfeudal/Raiden Shogun/`, clear all and type `cmd` on that, then enter and the terminal will release
 4. On that terminal, type:
 ```
 $ premake5 vs[version]
 ```
 Example: If you're using Visual Studio 2022 like me, just do like this:
 ```
 $ premake5 vs2022
 ```
 5. Rename the `.example.config.json` file to `config.json`. Add your bot token and client secret in that file:
 ```json
 {
    "token": "[add your bot token in here]",
    "client_secret": "[add your bot secret in here]"
 }
 ```
 6. Build, run, and enjoy!

 ### üìú Some notes
 This project is currently support for who is in these cases:
 - Microsoft Windows 10 `x64`
 - Visual Studio platform `x64`
 - C++ 17 `ISO/IEC 14882`
 - Please install `.dll` files on [dpp page](https://dpp.dev/) and put it near your `.exe` executable file so that it will run well

 Other cases may not compile or crash occurs.

### üë∑ Code platform
- Visual Studio Enterprise 2022
- Visual Studio Code

### üíé Future plan
- [x] Add `premake5.lua`
- [ ] CMake support soon!
- [x] Code works well (currently)

 ### ü§ù Support me
 - Please leave me a star if you like it. Thank you very much!
 - You can probably help me to develop this project too by DMing me on my [Discord profile (Harshfeudal#0001)](https://discord.com/users/622450109317251088).

 ### :computer: Contribution and Pull Request
  I'd probably glad to see if you have anything new to help and support me. To do that, please make one and before you do that, just make sure you've tested the code by using your bot. I won't bite you if you do wrong, but just make sure that you need to test it clearly before I merge it.
