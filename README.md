## About this project
- This project is owned by @harshfeudal. You can join my Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/BAk2CXpRAT)!
- This respiratory is under-construction! I'll update it as soon as possible.
- I'm not highly recommended you to use C++ to code a Discord bot, instead of JavaScript or others library. To know how's this project works, you should learn some basics about C++ so that you can know what I am doing.

 ### Support me
 - Please leave me a star if you like it. Thank you very much!
 - You can probably help me to develop this project too by DMing me on my [Discord profile (Harshfeudal#0001)](https://discord.com/users/622450109317251088).

 ### Contribution and Pull Request
  I'd probably glad to see if you have anything new to help and support me. To do that, please make a pull request and before you request a new pull request, make sure that you've tested the code by using your bot. I won't bite you if you do wrong, but just make sure that you need to test it clearly before I merge it.

 ### Special thanks
  - My bot avatar artist (Please contact me if you're the owner of that avatar so that I can link your resource).
  - My companions on D++ Discord server!
  - My friends
  - And you too, for staring this project and encourage me to do it!
